        		The player has to walk near (1km) to the clue to discover it. 
        		When you discover a clue, you can review it on the Solve Page where you can see all the clues you discovered yet.
        		On the Solve Page, you can try to resolve the enigma thanks to the clues. 
        		If you\'re wrong, you can try again or come back to the map to discover an other clue. If you\'re right, you win and you can quit the game. 
        		Each time you open the game, a new enigma is loaded.
        		Enjoy ! :)</string>
